<center><head>A Deeper Dive into KinitoPET</head></center>
<body>
<center><br> In this project I want to explore games that have an unlying aspect to them and that have connections to real world situations<br></center>
<center><img src="GamePage.jpg" alt="KinitoPET Steam Picture"></center>
<center><br>This image gives the player the first impression of this game<br></center>
<center><br>The first hint that the player gets the Kinito is more than what he seems is through the background sound "Questions" which plays during the Best Friend  Analysis. During this Kinito asks the user many innocent questions about their life while this music plays. Throughtout the sound it starts to slow and sounds a little bit darker which differs from the rest of the sounds the player has heard before this moment.</br></center>
