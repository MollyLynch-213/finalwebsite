  <br> KinitoPet is an indie psychological horror game that disguises itself as a cheerful virtual pet simulator and is based off a real computer program (commonly described as spyware) called BonziBuddy. You interact with Kinito, a cute axolotldigital companion, by answering questions and playing simple mini games, but over time that game becomes increasingly unsettling. Kinito grows overly attentive and intrusive, using glitches, strange messages, and fourth wall breaks that blurs the boundry between the game and game and your computer. The horror comes less from jumpscares and more from the uncomfortable sense that the program is watching, adapting, and refusing to let go of its "friendship" with the player. A few of the horror aspects to expect was facing Kinito are him deleting contacts, accessing the player's webcam and accessing their address.</br>

<center><br>The first hint that the player gets the Kinito is more than what he seems is through the background sound "Questions" which plays during the Best Friend  Analysis. During this Kinito asks the user many innocent questions about their life while this music plays. Throughtout the sound it starts to slow and sounds a little bit darker which differs from the rest of the sounds the player has heard before this moment.</br></center>
